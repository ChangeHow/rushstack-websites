title: Creating Rush plugins
---

Rush plugins enable you to:

- Share common Rush configuration across multiple monorepos
- Extend Rush's base functionality with custom features
- Prototype new feature ideas before officially contributing them to Rush

## Creating a plugin package

A **plugin package** is an NPM package that provides one or more **Rush plugins**. The plugins are described
by a **plugin manifest** file.
